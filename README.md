# Movie List 
As you can see from the title of this repository this is one of the school projects I had to work on, this project spans across 2 lessons. 
The reason why I choose to put this project on the project highlights is because this was one of the notable projects that has CRUD in it.
There was also quite abit of enhancement done to the project. Below you can see the details for this project.

## ðŸ›  Skills/Tools
Java, Android Studio, Illustrator(creation of the splash screen icons),
<a href="https://www.android-arsenal.com/details/1/7959#!description">Android Arsenal-Material Dialog</a>


## Lessons Learned
It was my first time dealing with dialog boxes but our lecturer mention that we can try and 
implement custom material dialog boxes from android arsenal if we wanted to challenge ourselves, so I give it a shot.
It was a small struggle at first to implement it but I manage to overcome it by patiently studying the documentation for the android arsenal dialog box.
Another which I learn from doing this project was doing the splash screen that has a simple animation.
